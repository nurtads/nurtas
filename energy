    <h1>Law of Conservation of Energy</h1>

    <img id="energyImage" src="energy.png" alt="Energy">

    <p>
        The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant over time.
        Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another.
    </p>

    <p>
        This fundamental principle governs various physical processes, emphasizing the interconnectedness
        and conservation of different forms of energy, such as kinetic, potential, thermal, and others.
    </p>

    <p>
        Understanding and applying the law of conservation of energy is crucial in physics and engineering,
        providing insights into the behavior of natural systems and guiding the development of technologies.
